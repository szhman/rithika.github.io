## Intro

Sometimes its nice to be selective - I want things to turn up in certain places for certain users at certain times based on certain conditions - that's why WEM and I get along so well.

I have put together a quick module for the hydration kit which allows you to get a little funky with select common shell folder objects such as admin tools, certain Control Panel applets and common folders that I find handy.

It's nothing major, the list is below:

-  Add Programs
-  Admin Tools
-  All Apps
-  Change Remove Programs
-  Control Panel
-  Installed Updates
-  Internet Explorer Cache
-  Internet Explorer Cookies
-  Libraries
-  Network Connections
-  Printers
-  Recent

As always, the kit has been split into a separate module that you can import, along with the master branch containing the updates.

## Script
