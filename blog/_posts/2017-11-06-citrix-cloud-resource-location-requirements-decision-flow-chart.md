<!--excerpt-->

A short while back I wrote a [piece](https://jkindon.wordpress.com/2017/09/12/110/) around the potential misconception of what is, and what is not required on premises, when dealing with the Citrix Cloud XenApp and XenDesktop Service offering

As much as words are fun, a picture is worth a thousand, so I have put together a decision map which I hope provides a bit more clarity in a visual way, when starting to think about how the offering fits for you or your clients, and what is still required to be managed by you based on the technologies you choose to implement

A copy of this file can be found [here](https://1drv.ms/i/s!Aias4D6K7Iqe1mDjkgFcLEUAqocB) (Not smart enough to make it look good in wordpress) and more than happy to share the vsdx if anyone is interested

I hope it helps in some small way
